# Camfrog standalone feature apps

Windows only. Uses UI Automation. Selectors are derived from static analysis of Camfrog 8.5.0.51219 and **not yet verified on a live session** — run `detect` first.

Full user manual: `docs/USER-MANUAL-EN.md` (Thai: `docs/USER-MANUAL-TH.md`).

## Standalone feature apps

Each executable is built into its own folder and creates its own config and runtime files there. Config, logs, status pools, and history are not shared between the apps.

| App | Scope |
|---|---|
| `room-control\room-control.exe` | Room control and room auto-reply. Status changes and private IM reply are disabled. |
| `chat-im-private\chat-im-private.exe` | Lists and focuses private-chat windows that are already open in Camfrog. It does not read or send messages. |
| `status-random\status-random.exe` | Random status rotation with its own ten-slot pool under `random-data\`. |
| `status-marquee\status-marquee.exe` | Marquee status rotation with its own ten-slot pool and Loop control under `marquee-data\`. |
| `im-autoreply\im-autoreply.exe` | Private IM auto-reply only. Room auto-reply and status changes are disabled. |
| `music-dj\music-dj.exe` | Room music DJ: answers `!request` / `!queue` / `!current` / `!skip` / `!help` in chat, keeps a persistent queue, and can play Windows MCI-supported audio files locally into Camfrog. Choose the music folder with Browse. Status changes and private IM reply are disabled. |
| `web-status\web-status.exe` | GUI + console prototype: update status via profiles.camfrog.com (dry-run by default; the GUI verifies a browser `PHPSESSID` session before live rotation). No args opens the GUI; any args use the CLI. The GUI has ten one-line status fields saved in `webtext.db`; **Start** rotates through the non-empty lines every N seconds. |

Room Control and IM Auto-reply use separate `config.json` files; Chat IM Private uses `private-chat-config.json`; Random and Marquee each use `camfrog-status-config.json` in their own data folder. Random and Marquee also keep their pools, logs, history, and worker files separate. Status **Start** saves settings and starts that app's bundled worker.

## Build

Double-click `build.bat` (needs 64-bit Python in PATH). It selects Python 3.12 first and builds the six apps above into separate subfolders under `dist\`. It preserves each app's local config and runtime data when refreshing the binaries, copies no shared `config.json`, and creates a zip containing only the executables and checksums. It also writes `dist\SHA256SUMS.txt`.

- **Icon:** replace `app.ico` (a real multi-size `.ico`, ideally 16–256 px) and rebuild. If Explorer still shows the old icon it is the Windows icon cache: rename/move the exe or restart Explorer.
- **Checksums & zip:** `SHA256SUMS.txt` lists each executable's path inside `dist\`; `tools\package.py` creates it and the zip using Python. Verify an app with `certutil -hashfile dist\room-control\room-control.exe SHA256`.

### Build troubleshooting

Run **`doctor.bat`** first. It prints your Python version/bit/build type, flags known-bad setups, detects an old copy of this project, and tests whether pip can fetch `pywin32`.

`pywin32 ... no matching distribution` means pip has **no wheel for your Python**. pywin32 312 ships wheels for CPython 3.9–3.15, **64-bit (and ARM64) only on 3.9–3.13**. Not covered: 32-bit Python ≤ 3.13, free-threaded (`3.xt`) builds, PyPy, Python < 3.8. Fix: `winget install Python.Python.3.13` (64-bit), delete the `.venv` folder, run `build.bat` again.

If the error says `requirements.txt (line 1)` and mentions only pywinauto, you are running an **older copy** of the project — extract the newest zip into a new empty folder.

## Quick start

1. Open Camfrog and join a room. For Camfrog 8.x, launch `room-control.exe` and use **Setup → Auto-detect**. Findings: `docs/CAMFROG-8.5-FINDINGS.md`.
2. Edit that app's `config.json`, set your nickname, and configure room replies. Keep `dry_run` on while checking behavior.
3. Use `im-autoreply.exe` for private IM auto-reply; its config and logs are separate from Room Control.
4. Use `status-random.exe` or `status-marquee.exe` to configure status messages in the corresponding app's data folder. Dry-run is enabled by default; enable **Send statuses live to Camfrog** before using **Apply Now** or **Start** to send them.
5. Open a private chat in Camfrog, then use `chat-im-private.exe` to refresh and focus its window. Its **Discover controls** button dumps the control tree to `controls.txt` for selector setup, like the other apps.

`python camfrog_auto.py ...` remains available as a source-only developer CLI. It uses the local `config.json`, which is ignored by Git; create it with `python camfrog_auto.py init --config config.json` or copy `config.example.json`. CI and builds validate the safe example. The CLI is not one of the six packaged apps. The `extras\*.bat` helpers are source-checkout shortcuts, except `extras\gui.bat` which launches the built `dist\room-control\room-control.exe`.

## Background mode

Room Control and IM Auto-reply use the GUI **Save & Start** and **Stop** controls. Status apps use their own **Start** and **Stop** controls and bundled background worker.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `python camfrog_auto.py start --config config.json` | Source CLI: run hidden, no window |
| `python camfrog_auto.py state --config config.json` | Source CLI: show if running |
| `python camfrog_auto.py stop --config config.json` | Source CLI: graceful stop |

Each app writes logs beside its own config. The source CLI uses `camfrog_auto.log` in the repository folder.

**Heads-up:** Windows has no way to type into another app without focusing it. Each send briefly brings Camfrog to the front, presses Enter, then returns focus to your previous window (`safety.restore_previous_window`). Camfrog must be open (minimized is OK only if UIA can still reach its controls — verify with `discover`).

## Scrolling status + history switch

- **Marquee** (`status.marquee`): long statuses scroll across a window of `width` characters, one frame every `step_seconds` (minimum 0.3 s). Finite `cycles` settle on the full text; **Loop** repeats the frame list until `status.interval_seconds`, then advances to the next status. The default advances 2 Thai-safe clusters every 0.5 seconds; the runner wakes at each frame deadline without an extra random delay after sending.
- **History switch** (`status.history`): every status you set is saved to `status_history.json`. With `use_as_source: true` the next status is picked from that history (`rotate` = round-robin, `random`, `most_used`). Your `status.messages` are seeded into it automatically.
- **TH/EN auto switch** (`status.language_cycle: ["th","en"]`): alternates Thai, English, Thai, English… each time the status changes. Works with history and with plain messages.
- **Safety:** every frame is a real status change on Camfrog, so frames are rate-limited (`step_seconds >= 0.3`); **Loop** repeats until the configured status interval. Keep `interval_seconds` generous and start with `dry_run: true`.
- **Live status send:** the status apps start in dry-run mode. **Apply Now** reports that no status was sent until **Send statuses live to Camfrog** is enabled. Live sends focus Camfrog for the Enter action, then restore the previous window.
- **Experimental background Enter target:** if Windows plays an error sound on every status change, the Random and Marquee Status apps have **Try combo Enter (test)**. They post Enter to the verified status ComboBox instead of its Edit child, without raising the Camfrog window. This might not commit the status on your Camfrog version; test one status with **Apply Now** and verify it persists before using marquee. Uncheck to restore the original behavior. See `status.background_enter_target` in `CONFIG-EN.md`.

Preview offline without opening Camfrog:
```
python camfrog_auto.py marquee "a long status that scrolls" --width 20
python camfrog_auto.py history                       # list history
python camfrog_auto.py history-add "hello"            # add
python camfrog_auto.py history-import old_status.txt # one status per line
```

## Extra tools

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `python camfrog_auto.py init --config config.json` | Source CLI: write a starter config |
| `python camfrog_auto.py test-rules "text" --config config.json` | Source CLI: test reply rules offline |
| `python camfrog_auto.py state --config config.json` | Source CLI: running state and counters |

- **Hot reload:** edit `config.json` while running; valid changes apply within ~3 s, invalid ones are rejected and logged (setting `dry_run` to `false` without `own_nickname` is rejected).
- **Variables:** `{sender}` `{me}` `{time}` `{date}` in statuses and replies.
- **Schedules:** different status pools by time of day (`status.schedules`).
- **Mention rules:** `"mention": true` replies only when your nick appears in the message.
- **Spam guard:** `ignore_links` (default on) and `skip_patterns`.

## Development

Install `requirements-dev.txt` and run the offline test suite from the source checkout. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs tests on Ubuntu and builds the feature apps on Windows. Audit notes: `AUDIT.md`. Full user manual: `docs/USER-MANUAL-EN.md`.

## Language

`"language": "auto"` follows the Windows UI language. Override with `--lang th` or `--lang en`. Status items can be `{th, en}` pairs and replies follow the language of the incoming message — see `CONFIG-EN.md`.

## Private-message auto-reply (opt-in)

Use `im-autoreply.exe`; its `config.json` is private to that app. Room auto-reply never touches private chats. IM auto-reply has its own rules, a **mandatory friend allowlist** (`only_nicknames`), its own dry-run and stricter limits (default: one reply per friend per hour, 3 per day, 10 per hour). Every reply starts with `[auto] `, and lines carrying that prefix are never answered. Windows already open when the bot starts are never answered; a window that opens later with one line from a listed friend is.

Set `autoreply.own_nickname`, `autoreply_im.only_nicknames`, and `autoreply_im.rules` in that app's config. Keep `dry_run: true` until you have checked its behavior, then enable live mode from this app only when ready.

**Not verified on a live session:** the IM window's send path (the panes match the room's, per the findings). The `wb-log-mtim-data` window kind (probably tabbed IM) is deliberately ignored. `private_chat_request` (incoming private-chat requests) is never auto-accepted. See `CONFIG-EN.md`.

## Safety

`dry_run` is on by default; replies are rate-limited (per-sender cooldown, global gap, hourly cap); lines not in `name: message` form are ignored; replies starting with `/` are blocked; there is no auto-kick. Check Camfrog's terms and your room's rules before enabling automation.
